:mountain: Mini game about dealing with anxiety and panic attacks

---

Feather is a mini game inspired by [Celeste.](http://www.celestegame.com/) It's purpose is to visualize the [floating feather meditation technique](http://davidvago.bwh.harvard.edu/the-floating-feather-meditation-technique/), a technique designed to relax and reduce anxiety.

The idea of this technique is really simple: you close your eyes and imagine a feather in front of you. When you inhale, the feather rises a few inches, when you exhale, it descends. Keeping a simple count of four for the inhalation, two for a pause and four for the exhalation, you will get into a rythm that will help you when you have trouble breathing, or in the middle of a panic attack.

The game helps you visualize the feather. Whenever you press the spacebar, the feather rises, when you release it, it will descend. Just keep the feather inside the white box and breathe while you play.

The game is developed in LÃ¶ve 0.10.1 (written in Lua), and the binary files for offline play can be found in the releases section of this repo.
